# How to run
After cloning the directory, install dependencies with npm/yarn

`npm install`

You can run the backend with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

### You will have to do the same on the front end as well
Install the dependencies with the frontend in `./client/`

`cd client`

`npm install`

#### Run the frontend in `./client/` with `npm run start` or `yarn start`, and run the backend in the parent directory in another terminal with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. Both *MUST* be running for MaxiClip to properly function.

## Congratulations! You can now enter the worlds most premiere gaming center ;) 

MaxiClip's default url resolves to localhost:3000. The backend (and the games) serve out of localhost:8000.
